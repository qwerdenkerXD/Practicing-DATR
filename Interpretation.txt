Interpretation for numpy.random.seed(1):

The simulated experiment worked, since there are essential differences between the expressions before and after treatment.

Replicate 1 worked for all patients differently, since it either did nothing or cured a diseased gene.
Replicate 2 worked only for patient 3, but cured all genes.
Replicate 3 worked, it decreases the expression of gene 5 and can cure gene 9.

If I took this experiment as not simulated, I would analyse what's so special with patient 3 that the second replicate cured all diseased genes. If that wasn't just a lucky result, this replicate would be a great choice for therapies. For genes 5 and 9 the third replicate is a good choice.
If nothing helps, the first replicate is a well trial-and-error candidate
